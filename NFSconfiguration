1. Provision a 'EBS' Volume and attach to the instance, in which you want to configure the NFS.

2. Run the command ' fdisk  -l' to identify the mount point of the new volume.

(In this example , i am assuming it as /dev/xvdf' )


3. To Create a partition Run ' fdisk   /dev/xvdf' .

4.Press Enter and (If no other change requires, accept the default values).

5. Run w! to write the partition to the new disk.

(You can verify the partition using the command 'fdisk /dev/xvdf' and press 'p' )

6. Configure the filesystem on the new partition using the command   'mkfs.xfs  /dev/xvdf1'.

7.Create a new mount pint for the new partition in the system using 'mkdir /srv/nfs'

8.Create a new entry in '/etc/fstab'  

It may looks like

/dev/xvdf1      /srv/nfs      xfs     defaults    0 0 


9. Run the command 'mount -a'.

10. Verify the partition using the command 'df -h'

11. Install the 'nfs' package using 'yum install nfs-utils'

12 Change the ownership of the new partition using  'chwon -R nfsnobody:nfsnobody  /srv/nfs'

13.Now change its access mode using 'chmod -R 777 /srv/nfs'

14. Proceed to create an entry in '/etc/exports' file. Create an entry on  /etc/exports  file like  /srv/nfs          *(rw,root_squash)

15Now Run the command 'exportfs -a'

16.Verify the nfs share using the command 'exportfs'

17 If you are seeing the new nfs share for  /srv/nfs'   like  world ,/srv/nfs>,  you can proceed with the inventory configura




1.	Create a directory that will be used to mount the PV in /srv/nfs.
#mkdir pvsample
2.	Change the ownership  using the following. 
#chwon -R nfsnobody:nfsnobody  /srv/nfs'
3.	Now change its access mode using
#chmod -R 777 /srv/nfs'
4.	Create an entry in /etc/exports.d/openshift-ansible.exports file as following 
/srv/nfs/pvsample *(rw,root_squash)
5.	Now Run the following command 
exportfs -a
6.	Verify the nfs share using the command 'exportfs'
7.	Using a PV definition, create a PV. The sample definitions can be found in /root/Templates location on master node. Mount path should be the path to the created mount directory. If definition file is named as pvsample.yaml, create PV as following.
#oc create -f pvsample.yaml or oc create -f <path to definition file>
